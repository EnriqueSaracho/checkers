# Checkers Pizza

For my Web Development I course project, I created a website for a fictional pizza place called ‘Checkers’. It has four pages, a home page with cool images and posts, a menu page with all imaginary items available, a cart page and an account page. I got to use my skills learned throughout the course, including HTML tables, forms, lists, CSS styles, layouts, responsiveness, and JavaScript functionality.
